# Airbnb data analysis project -1
I use the free Airbnb data set from url http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. To understand the Airbnb most recent industry trend, I pulled data posted on July 2021 instead of using historical data on Kaggle. 
The main purpose of this project is to use CRISP-DM process find solutions.
