# Airbnb data analysis project -1
I use the free Airbnb data set from url http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. To understand the Airbnb most recent industry trend, I pulled data posted on July 2021 instead of using historical data on Kaggle. 
The main purpose of this project is to use CRISP-DM process find solutions.

# Questions to dig deep
1. What’s the most popular listing type in Airbnb? How do the listing types impact the listing price?
2. What other factors will influence the listing price?
3. What’s the best time to visit Boston?
4. Can we use the limit data to estimate the listing price?

# Data Set
In the Aribnb data analysis project, I use listing and canlendar data set. The canlandar data set file is too larger to upload into github. This data set can be downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html, archiving Boston Airbnb data on July 2021.
